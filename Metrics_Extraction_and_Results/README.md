# Placement Strategy Evaluation: HPWL and Runtime Comparison

This repository presents a comparative study of **Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL)** and **Runtime** across multiple ASIC designs using three placement strategies. The goal is to evaluate the impact of placement initialization and transport-aware modeling on placement quality and performance.

Each `<DESIGN>/` directory contains:
- Synthesis and placement output files  
- Intermediate netlists and DEFs  
- Logs (especially `3_3_place_gp.log`) with HPWL and runtime data  
- Any relevant flow configuration or script modifications

## Placement Strategies

### ðŸ”¹ RePlAce (Baseline)
Standard global placement using the RePlAce engine.

### ðŸ”¹ DREAMPlace â†’ RePlAce
DREAMPlace initializes the placement. The output DEF is then used by RePlAce to complete global placement.

### ðŸ”¹ Transport-Informed DREAMPlace â†’ RePlAce
An enhanced DREAMPlace model that accounts for transport effects is used for initialization. RePlAce is then used for global placement.

## Objective

Evaluate the impact of advanced placement flows on:
- **HPWL** â€” as an indicator of routing quality  
- **Runtime** â€” to measure flow efficiency  

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Each strategy folder includes a dedicated `README.md` detailing:
  - Input preparation steps
  - Flow configuration
  - How to run and extract results

- HPWL and runtime values can be found in:
  ```
  <strategy>/<TECHNOLOGY_NODE>/<DESIGN>/Logs/3_3_place_gp.log
  ```
- Results are aggregated in the Results/ directory.

---

## Notes

- Designs are grouped into **training** and **test** datasets.
- Technology nodes:
  - `ASAP7`
  - `NanGate45`
- Example designs include:
  - `GCD`, `IBEX`, `AES`, and `JPEG`

---

This repository provides a reproducible setup to benchmark and compare placement strategies across multiple designs and technology nodes.
