[INFO CTS-0050] Root buffer is BUFx16f_ASAP7_75t_R.
[INFO CTS-0051] Sink buffer is BUFx24_ASAP7_75t_R.
[INFO CTS-0052] The following clock buffers will be used for CTS:
                    BUFx16f_ASAP7_75t_R
                    BUFx24_ASAP7_75t_R
[INFO CTS-0049] Characterization buffer is BUFx24_ASAP7_75t_R.
[INFO CTS-0007] Net "clk" found for clock "clk".
[INFO CTS-0010]  Clock net "clk" has 562 sinks.
[INFO CTS-0008] TritonCTS found 1 clock nets.
[INFO CTS-0097] Characterization used 2 buffer(s) types.
