[INFO CTS-0050] Root buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0051] Sink buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0052] The following clock buffers will be used for CTS:
                    CLKBUF_X3
[INFO CTS-0049] Characterization buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0007] Net "clk" found for clock "clk".
[INFO CTS-0010]  Clock net "clk" has 4383 sinks.
[INFO CTS-0008] TritonCTS found 1 clock nets.
[INFO CTS-0097] Characterization used 1 buffer(s) types.
[INFO CTS-0200] 0 placement blockages have been identified.
[INFO CTS-0201] 0 placed hard macros will be treated like blockages.
[INFO CTS-0027] Generating H-Tree topology for net clk.
[INFO CTS-0028]  Total number of sinks: 4383.
[INFO CTS-0029]  Sinks will be clustered in groups of up to 50 and with maximum cluster diameter of 20.0 um.
[INFO CTS-0030]  Number of static layers: 0.
[INFO CTS-0020]  Wire segment unit: 14000  dbu (7 um).
[INFO CTS-0204] A clustering solution was found from clustering size of 50 and clustering diameter of 20.
[INFO CTS-0205] Better solution may be possible if either -sink_clustering_size, -sink_clustering_max_diameter, or both options are omitted to enable automatic clustering.
[INFO CTS-0019]  Total number of sinks after clustering: 691.
[INFO CTS-0024]  Normalized sink region: [(0.80449, 0.970714), (62.7686, 63.4293)].
[INFO CTS-0025]     Width:  61.9641.
[INFO CTS-0026]     Height: 62.4586.
